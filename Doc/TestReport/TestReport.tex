Initial State: The system is initially closed
                
Input: Source code of the system, Development Team(Inspectors)

Expected Output: Each module of the source code only contains one characteristic that is likely to change in the future.

Result: \textcolor{blue}{PASS}

Initial State: The system is initially closed
                
Input: Source code of the system, Development Team(Inspectors)

Expected Output: The code is documented according to the standard so that documentation can be generated with the support of doxygen without any presence of error and texts that were used for documenting the code were descriptive, concise and correct.

Result: \textcolor{blue}{PASS}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Cultural Requirement}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{NFS-C-1\\}

Description: The development team inspected the source code of the system to test if there is any asset(images, sounds) that is used in the implementation or displayed text on the general GUI of the system which would have any potential to be considered as offensive to any culture.

Initial State: The system is initially closed

Input: Source code, Sounds and images referenced in the source code of the system, Development Team(Inspectors)

Expected Output: There is not asset that is used in the source code and text which could be displayed on the general GUI that could be considered as offensive to any culture.

Result: \textcolor{blue}{PASS}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Unit Testing}

Unit Testing is a major part of the test suite for SpaceShooter and it is used because it excellently isolates and tests individual aspects of the program. This type of testing ensures that program runs without hiccups at the lowest level. Testing major aspects of the program should not be done before unit testing, as an error could be caused by many different methods in the program. Unit testing ensures that the program is completing its most basic functionalities perfectly. 

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

\noindent After completing the Spaceship Movement Operation tests (FS-M-1 and FS-M-2) it was detected that the top and bottom borders had not been set after the implementation of the up and down movement capabilities. These tests exposed that the spaceship could move beyond the visible top and bottom borders. After this realization, the top and bottom physical borders were implemented and the ship now cannot go beyond what is visible. 
\newline

\noindent The initial implementation of the new alien obstacles did not function correctly as the spaceship did not lose health after collision with is. This fault was exposed by conducting the Collision Detection test (FS-CD-2). After discovering this error, the Alien class was corrected.
\newline

\noindent All other parts of the program that were tested passed their respective tests. 

\section{Automated Testing}

As previously mentioned in the Test Plan document, the test team has decided not to implement any automated testing mechanisms. This decision was made considering the lack of canvas environment testing framework support and the strict time constraints. The test team felt that the time would be better used for the implementation of the game and for manual testing.

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}

The test suite designed by the test team produces roughly 93 percent code coverage through the tests. This is proven true given that all modules are covered through the tests, and this is confirmed above in the trace to modules section. The test suite tests all major components of the game, including all game functions and user interaction capabilities. The most important modules, which are the Game State and Game Objects modules, are thoroughly tested to ensure that the game runs without any errors or hiccups.
