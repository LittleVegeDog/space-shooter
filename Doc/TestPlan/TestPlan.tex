\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}

The function of the program is to run a 2D arcade style game that will provide a fun, refreshing gaming experience to people who are missing classic games from years ago. The purpose of testing this project is to ensure the game provides a smooth experience without any hiccups. Testing will build confidence that all of the game features and functionality have been implemented correctly.

\bigskip

The development team will be using Green, which is a fast and clean python test runner that has more detailed descriptions of tests which is more convenient for the developers. The functional tests will be based off of the functional requirements, and will be done using black box testing which ignores the implementation. 
To test the coverage of the code, the team will be using Coverage.py, which is an automated way to monitor the parts of the code that have been executed. Fault testing will be implemented in all areas of the code to ensure robustness of the software. 

\subsection{Scope}

The Test Plan provides a foundation for testing the features and functionality of the redesign of the 2D arcade game, SpaceShooter. The new version of SpaceShooter revamps the original game with the addition of new features, and to ensure these new additions run correctly, tests must be implemented. These new features include an improved user interface, new game-play features, and modularization of the code. All of these aspects must be thoroughly tested in order for the final program to run smoothly.

\subsection{Overview of Document}

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
Space Shooter is a recreation of the Python game project which is also called 'Space Shooter'. The system shall allow its user controls an in-game space ship flying in a rectangular piece of space. Simultaneously, there are obstacles flying in the piece of space from top to bottom. As the ultimate goal of the game, user shall try to control the space ship to survive as long as possible by avoid letting the ship collide on any obstacle. The system shall also allow the user to control the space ship to shoot lasers which can destroy the obstacles.  
\subsection{Test Team}
The test team for this project consists of all of the members in Team \#105 which includes: Hongzhao Tan, Nishanth Raveendran, Dananjay Prabaharan
\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
The test team has decided that only strict manual approach would be used for testing due to many reasons which includes but not limits to: Lack of canvas environment testing framework support, Lack of time resource given. Hence, automated testing approach would not be employed to test the system. 
\subsection{Testing Tools}
Since the test team will be only using manual approach to test the system, there would be only electrical devices with all major operating system and appropriate software and hardware configuration used as tools for testing.

\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}

The proof of concept for SpaceShooter goes over the additions of the new features and redesign. This includes modularizing the code, and creating a new, cleaner user interface. Gameplay additions include involving an in game store, adding more directional control of the ship, and including new interactive objects (enemies, powerups, etc.). 

\bigskip
In the original proof of concept, the game closed when the player died. The goal for the redesign is to have a better user interface which has an end game screen which displays stats and allows the player to replay or return to the main menu. This issue was resolved and tested using the ‘Main Menu’ and ‘Paused’ tests based on the functional requirements. These tests ensure the player has access to all of these screens even after the player dies. 

\bigskip
The primary issue of the original proof of concept is that the code is all in one file and not modularized. This is very messy and does not follow proper coding practices. Having consistency tests will ensure the program functions identically to the original reference game after modularizing the code. 

\subsection{Proof of Concept Tests}
		
\paragraph{Consistency Tests}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{PCS-C-1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: Screen is initially at the 'Playing Game' state
					
Input: A person who has played the original reference game will play the game until the ship dies
					
Output/Result: The person plays through the game a number of times, while taking note of how the game functions.
					
How test will be performed: A person who has played the original game with a solid understanding of how it functions will play the updated version which has modularized code. The game functions should be identical, and the purpose of this test is to ensure that everything runs smoothly. 
					
\item{PCS-C-2\\}

Type: Structural, Static, Manual
					
Initial State: The system is initially closed
					
Input: The source code of the system, code inspectors 
					
Output/Result: Verification of method functionality
					
How test will be performed: A development team member will perform a dry run and ensure each method runs identically to the original without errors. The main purpose of this test is to ensure the functions can still communicate with each other after modularization of the code.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Unit Testing Plan}
Unit Testing would be conducted on this project using the 'unittest' Python framework.
		
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
Several unit tests would be executed for the internal functions of the program. Internal functions that return values within the program could be unit tested using the assert command from the 'unittest' framework. The team's plan is to have at least 3-5 assert commands per each function/method in the program. \textcolor{red}{Stubs and drivers would not be utilized during the testing phase as most of the added modules/features would be independent and not rely on one another.} In order to adequately test the entire program, our team would be utilizing the coverage test method. The coverage test method is a measurement based on the percentage of the original source code that is being tested. The team's goal for the coverage test measurement in our codebase is 75\%. 

		
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}		
As no files are being outputted within the SpaceShooter program, unit testing is not necessary for this component.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}
Look and Feel Questions:\\
- Could the shape and color configurations of the space ship make the space ship well-marked ?\\
- Are you satisfied with how the lasers and animation of explosion looks like ?\\
- Is there any in-game object covered up by the color of the game's background when you were playing ?\\
- Do you think the sizes and fonts that are used for the text in the system is appropriate ?\\
- Have you ever felt intense when you were playing the game ?\\
- Have you ever felt the graphical user interface (The graphics displayed on the game window) been cluttered when you were playing the game ?\\
